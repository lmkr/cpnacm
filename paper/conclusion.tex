\section{Conclusions and Perspectives}

THEORY - TOOLS - PRACTICE?

Can be learned with reading the formal definitions. Functional prgramming has been an obstrace - but this is changing with the increased poplurao of funcational programming langauges such as Scala ...

Do we want to mention the expressiveness (theoretical) of CPNs?

State sapce of CPN models are often smaller because we can do complex data manipulation without introdcuing internmediate steps.

% future directions

The primary analysis of CPN models has been based on dynanmic analysis
by means of simulation or state space exploration. Static analysis of
CPN models involves combining stuctural analysis of the net structure
(i.e., places, transitions, and arcs) and static analysis of the
inscriptions (arc expressions and guards). Hence, static analysis of
CPN models must be combined with status analysis as known from
programming langauges. This is a research direction that has been
pursued only to a very limited extent.
