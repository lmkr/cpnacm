\section{Conclusions and Perspectives}

The development of CPNs has been driven by a research agenda with
simultaneous focus on theoretical development, design and
implementation of software tool support, and practical application and
case studies. These three aspects has had a clear mutual influence on
each other. A theoretical foundation is needed in order to develop
semantically sound software tools which in turn is needed for
practical applications which reveal limitations of the theoretical
foundation. An international standard for high-level Petri nets was
developed headed by Billington \cite{hcpnstandard} and approved in
2004. The high-level Petri net standard is heavily based on CPNs which
conforms to the standard.

An example of this is also that it was during
the creation of the computer tool support that the need of modules was
discovered and it was also in this phase that it became clear that the
type concept from programming languages was extremely adequate for
type definitions and net inscriptions (instead of using more ad-hoc
notations).}

The development of the CPN languages can be divided into four
steps which has many similarities with the developments in programming
languages. The first step from the black tokens of basic Petri nets to
colored tokens in PrT-nets corresponds to the step from bit
representation to simple data types. The second step from PrT-nets to
CPNs corresponds to the invention of structured data types and type
checking. The third step with the introduction of hierarchical CPNs
corresponds to the introduction of structuring concepts like modules,
procedures, functions and subroutines. The fourth step represented by
the development of Design/CPN and CPN Tools corresponds to the
implementation of compilers and run-time systems which are essential
for practical applications.

In this paper we have provided an overview and an introduction to the
CPN language and its computer tool support and we have discussed the
research development that led to the development of the CPN modeling
language as it exists today. The most recent monograph on Colored
Petri Nets has been published by Jensen and Kristensen in 2009
\cite{newcpnbook}. It provides an in-depth, but yet compact
introduction to modeling and validation of concurrent systems by means
of CPNs. The book introduces the constructs of the CPN modeling
language, presents its analysis methods, and provides a comprehensive
road map to the practical use of CPNs. Furthermore, the book presents
selected industrial case studies illustrating the practical use of
CPNs for design, specification, simulation, and verification in a
variety of application domains. The book is aimed at use both in
university courses and for self-study.

THEORY - TOOLS - PRACTICE?

Can be learned with reading the formal definitions. Functional prgramming has been an obstrace - but this is changing with the increased poplurao of funcational programming langauges such as Scala ...

Do we want to mention the expressiveness (theoretical) of CPNs?

State sapce of CPN models are often smaller because we can do complex data manipulation without introdcuing internmediate steps.

% future directions

The primary analysis of CPN models has been based on dynanmic analysis
by means of simulation or state space exploration. Static analysis of
CPN models involves combining stuctural analysis of the net structure
(i.e., places, transitions, and arcs) and static analysis of the
inscriptions (arc expressions and guards). Hence, static analysis of
CPN models must be combined with status analysis as known from
programming langauges. This is a research direction that has been
pursued only to a very limited extent.
