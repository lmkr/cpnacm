The development of CPNs has been motivated by aim of developing a
formally founded modelling for concurrent systems capable of modelling
and validating system occurring in typical industrial projects. Petri
nets provide the basic model to capture concurrency and
synchronisation. Petri nets has at it very nature concurrency and is
based on the approach of everything being concurrent unless it is
explicitly synchronisation. Petri nets are, however, not well-suited
for modelling large systems as models do not scale well in system
parameters, and it is not particular suited for modelling data
manipulation. To address this concern,...

THe davantage of Petri nets is that they have few basic concept and
still is able to expressa wide range of communication and
synchronisation concepts.

The majority of computing systems today relies inhereintely on
communication and synchronisation between concurrent and parallel
processes. When C.A. Petri conceined Petri nets in X and Y the
computing system of that time ... (maybe this as a side bar?)
