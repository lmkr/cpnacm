\section{CPN Tools and Applications}

The construction and analysis of CPN models have been supported by two
generations of graphical computer tools. The first generation was the
Design/CPN tool \cite{X} which was developed starting in the mid
80'es. This was followed by CPN Tools \cite{Y} that has been developed
since 2000 first by the CPN Group at the University of Aarhus and
since 2009? by the XX group at the Technical University Eindhoven. CPN
Tools supports the editing and construction of CPN models, interactive
and automatic simulation, state space-based model checking, and
simulation-based performance analysis. Both Design/CPN and CPN Tools
has been widely distributed tools and they have been applied for
modelling and validation in a broad range of application domainss.
