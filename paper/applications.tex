\section{CPN Tools and Applications}

The construction and analysis of CPN models have been supported by two
generations of graphical computer tools. The first generation was the
Design/CPN tool \cite{jensen:cpnmanual} which was developed starting
in the mid 80'es at Meta Software Corp. and later by the CPN Group at
the Aarhus University. This was followed by CPN Tools
\cite{cpntoolsweb} that has been developed since 2000 first by the CPN
Group at Aarhus University and since 2009? by the XX group at the
Technical University of Eindhoven. CPN Tools supports the editing and
construction of CPN models, interactive and automatic simulation,
state space-based model checking, and simulation-based performance
analysis. Both Design/CPN and CPN Tools has been widely distributed
tools and they have been applied for modelling and validation in a
broad range of application domains. Below we provide some pointer to
some selected applications within typical application domains. A more
comprehensive list of example applications and domains can be found
via \cite{cpnuse}.
