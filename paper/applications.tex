\section{CPN Tools and Applications}

The construction and analysis of CPN models have been supported by two
generations of graphical computer tools. The first generation was the
Design/CPN tool \cite{X} which was developed starting in the mid 80'es
at Meta Software Corp. and later by the CPN Group at the University of
Aarhus. This was followed by CPN Tools \cite{Y} that has been
developed since 2000 first by the CPN Group at the University of
Aarhus and since 2009? by the XX group at the Technical University of
Eindhoven. CPN Tools supports the editing and construction of CPN
models, interactive and automatic simulation, state space-based model
checking, and simulation-based performance analysis. Both Design/CPN
and CPN Tools has been widely distributed tools and they have been
applied for modelling and validation in a broad range of application
domains. Below we provide some pointer to some selected applications
within typical application domains. A more comprehensive list of
example applications and domains can be found via \cite{X}.
