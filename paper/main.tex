% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@hq.acm.org

% For tracking purposes - this is V3.1SP - APRIL 2009

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{2} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}

Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) combine Petri nets with a programming
language to obtain a scalable modeling language for concurrent
systems. Petri nets provide the formal foundation for modeling
concurrency and synchronization, and a programming language provides
the primitives for modeling data manipulation and creating compact and
parameterizable models. We provide an example driven introduction to
the core syntactical and semantical constructs of the CPN modeling
language, and briefly survey how quantitative and qualitative
behavioral properties of CPN models can be validated using
simulation-based performance analysis and explicit state space
exploration. In addition, we give an overview of CPN Tools, which
provide software tool support for the practical use of CPNs, and we
provide pointers to projects where the CPN technology has been put
into practical use in an industrial setting. As we proceed, we give a
historical perspective on the research contributions that led to the
development of the CPN technology.

\paragraph*{Acknowledgements}  We are indepted to the many colleagues and researchers who have contributed to the development and application of CPNs. In particular, Jawahar Malhotra had the idea to use the Standard ML language
as a basis for type definitions and net inscriptions in Design/CPN,
Ole Bach Andersen implemented the graphical interface of Design/CPN,
and S\o{}ren Christensen implemented the complex inference algorithms
for automatic variable binding during simulations. Hartmann
Genrich contributed to Design/CPN with knowledge and experience from
PrT nets. The graphical user interface of CPN Tools was designed
together with Michel Beaudouin-Lafon and Wendy McKay.
